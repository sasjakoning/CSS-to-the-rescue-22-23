This repository is all about the course CSS To The Rescue of the minor Web Design & Development at the CMD Amsterdam.

## 🗒️ Debrief 🗒️

The goal of this course is to experiment with CSS to create something unique and interesting. I'll look into the possibilities of CSS and new experimental features. In the end I'll not only turn in something visually pleasing, but also show of my experiments and the process of creating it.

<br>

There are four themes to choose from for this assignment;

- A modular control panel
- An interactive fireworks show
- A 3d Rubik's cube
- Converting a Tailwind project to modern CSS.

I decided to go with a mix of the modular control panel and the rubiks cube.

## ✔️ Personal goals ✔️

There are a few things I want to learn and/or get better at during this course.

- Learn more about new CSS features like `:has()` , `:is()` and `:where()` 
- Develop my skills when it comes to 3d CSS and animations
- Work on a smaller project to be able to go more into detail and experiment more
- Have some fun :)

## 🤔 Prolouge 🤔

In the week before the course started I started to think about what I wanted to make. I liked the challenge of the Rubik's cube, but wanted something slightly different. On my desk I always have a fidget toy that's called an Infinity Cube. This cube is made up of 8 smaller cubes that can be moved around to create different shapes. I thought it would be fun to make a digital version of this cube.

I started planning out the steps on animation and numbered the different sides of the cube.

<br>

I set up the base html structure and created all the seperate cubes and buttons to trigger the animations.
Eventually I came across an issue where overlapping transform origins caused the cubes to rotate in the wrong direction. This proved to be quite difficult to fix and brought my project to a standstill.

Eventually I decided to start over and make a modular control panel instead. I found this to be more interesting and, since I want to be able to finish this project, a bit easier to make. 

<br>

I still wish to continue making the Infinity Cube some day, but I'll have to do some more research on how to fix the issue I ran into. Sanne(teacher) already adviced me to use CSS variables which may prove to be useful.

## 👚 Chosen theme 👚

I decided to go with a modular control panel. I wanted to make something that was a bit more complex than the examples given in the course but still give myself the opportunity to experiment with new CSS features.  

The control panel I've chosen is of a washing machine. I was thinking about all kinds of interesting control panels and somehow managed to end up with a washing machine. The control panel itself is quite simple, but I wanted to create the entire machine in 3d which could offer me some interesting challenges.

Below is the machine I decided to use as reference. I may change some things in the design but this gets the general idea.
